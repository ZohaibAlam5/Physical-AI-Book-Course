# Prompt History Record: Table of Contents Page Update

## User Prompt
Update the table of contents page in website/src/pages/toc.js to include all 48 chapters (12 chapters × 4 modules) with proper titles and links. The page was only showing a few chapters instead of all chapters.

## Response Text
Updated the toc.js file to include all 48 chapters across all 4 modules with correct titles and links. The table of contents page now properly displays:

1. All 12 chapters for Module 1: Physical AI Foundations & the Robotic Nervous System
2. All 12 chapters for Module 2: Digital Twins & Robot Simulation
3. All 12 chapters for Module 3: Perception, Navigation & the AI Robot Brain
4. All 12 chapters for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action & Autonomous Humanoids

Each chapter is properly linked to its corresponding page, and the titles match exactly what's in the actual chapter files.

## Outcome
The table of contents page now correctly displays all 48 chapters with proper navigation links, resolving the issue where only a few chapters were showing.
