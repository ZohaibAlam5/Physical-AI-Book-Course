# Prompt History Record: Index Page Update

## User Prompt
Update index.js according to the physical AI book and include all four modules with relevant information. The page was showing only three modules, and needed to be updated with all four modules and relevant information.

## Response Text
Updated the index.js file to align with the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book theme and include all four modules:

1. Updated the homepage to display all 4 modules in a grid layout (col--3 for each module)
2. Module 1: Physical AI Foundations - Embodied intelligence and ROS 2 fundamentals
3. Module 2: Digital Twins & Simulation - Advanced simulation techniques and digital twin technologies
4. Module 3: Perception & Navigation - Perception systems, navigation, and AI robot brain concepts
5. Module 4: Vision-Language-Action - Complete autonomous humanoid systems with VLA paradigms
6. Updated the description to reflect Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics focus
7. Updated the about section to explain the book's focus on embodied intelligence and physical systems
8. Ensured all modules are properly represented with appropriate links to their first chapters

## Outcome
The homepage now correctly displays all 4 modules with relevant descriptions and navigation links, properly representing the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book structure.
