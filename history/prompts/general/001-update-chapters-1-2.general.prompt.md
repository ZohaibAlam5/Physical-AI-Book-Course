## Prompt

Update Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of Module 1 according to the topics given in tasks.md. Chapter 1 should cover "Embodied Intelligence concepts" and Chapter 2 should cover "Digital vs Physical AI differences".

## Response

Updated both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book website:

1. Chapter 1 was updated to cover "Embodied Intelligence concepts" with:
   - Learning objectives specific to embodied intelligence
   - Definition and explanation of embodied intelligence
   - Key principles of embodied intelligence
   - Components of embodied intelligence systems
   - Role of embodiment in learning
   - Applications in humanoid robotics
   - Practical example with Python code for balance control
   - Proper chapter summary and next steps

2. Chapter 2 was updated to cover "Digital vs Physical AI differences" with:
   - Learning objectives specific to comparing digital vs physical AI
   - Core differences between digital and physical AI
   - The embodiment factor and its implications
   - Practical implications for system design
   - Comparative example showing both digital and physical AI approaches to object recognition
   - Proper chapter summary and next steps

Both chapters now align with the Physical AI and humanoid robotics theme as required by the tasks specification, with appropriate technical content, examples, and connections to humanoid robotics applications.

## Outcome

Successfully updated the content of both chapters to match the specifications in tasks.md, creating comprehensive educational content about embodied intelligence and the differences between digital and physical AI systems in the context of humanoid robotics.
