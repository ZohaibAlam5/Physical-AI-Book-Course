## Prompt

for the physical Ai book

## Response snapshot

I've successfully completed the clarification session for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book with the following results:

**Questions Asked & Answered (5/5):**
1. ROS 2 knowledge prerequisites: Intermediate level with basic understanding of nodes, topics, services, and tf2
2. Hardware requirements: Provide hardware recommendations for optimal learning, including minimum system specs for simulation
3. Example format: Detailed examples with code snippets and diagrams but no full runnable applications
4. Assessment methods: Include practice exercises with solutions, self-assessment quizzes, and project-based challenges
5. Search performance: Vector search response times under 500ms with 95%+ accuracy for relevant content

**Path to updated spec:** `D:\\Coding\\GeminiClaude\\book\\specs\\001-physical-ai-book\\spec.md`

**Sections touched:** Added "Clarifications" section with "Session 2025-12-17" subsection

**Coverage summary:**
- Functional Scope & Behavior: Resolved
- Domain & Data Model: Clear
- Interaction & UX Flow: Resolved
- Non-Functional Quality Attributes: Resolved
- Integration & External Dependencies: Clear
- Edge Cases & Failure Handling: Clear
- Constraints & Tradeoffs: Resolved
- Terminology & Consistency: Clear
- Completion Signals: Clear
- Misc / Placeholders: Clear

All critical ambiguities have been resolved. The specification is now ready to proceed to the planning phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Clarified 5 critical ambiguities in the Physical AI book specification
- 🧪 Tests: spec file updated with clarifications section
- 📁 Files: specs/001-physical-ai-book/spec.md modified
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan for the Physical AI book
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification now has clear requirements for prerequisites, hardware, examples, assessments, and performance

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin planning phase for the Physical AI book
